[Camera movement description] over [duration]. [Lighting description].
[Subject action]. [Background motion]. The mood is [mood].
Sound: [audio description].
```

**Example:**
```
A young woman walks through an empty art gallery at twilight. Shot on Arri
Alexa with a 40mm anamorphic lens. Slow Steadicam follow from behind,
gradually orbiting to a 3/4 angle over 8 seconds. Soft museum spotlights
create pools of warm light on the hardwood floor, her shadow stretching
long. She pauses in front of a large abstract painting, tilts her head
slightly. Background: other visitors move slowly in the far distance,
blurred. The mood is contemplative and solitary. Sound: echoing footsteps
on wood, distant murmur of conversation, gentle HVAC hum.
```

## Product Demo

```
Professional demonstration of [product/tool] in [environment].
[Camera starts at] then [camera movement] to reveal [detail].
[Lighting setup]. [Hands/person interacting with product].
Clean, focused, [adjective] composition. Sound: [audio].
```

**Example:**
```
Professional demonstration of a photo editing workflow on a tablet in a
bright home office. Camera starts on a wide shot of the desk, then slowly
tracks in to a close-up of the screen showing a photo being enhanced. Soft
directional window light from the left with a subtle fill from a desk lamp.
Hands confidently swipe through editing tools, applying a color filter with
a satisfying tap. Clean, modern composition with shallow depth of field
blurring the background plants. Sound: soft UI interaction sounds, gentle
tap of finger on screen, quiet ambient music.
```

## Social Reel (9:16)

```
Eye-catching vertical video for [platform]. [Hook in first second].
[Bold visual description]. [Fast/energetic camera movement].
[Color grade]. [Duration] seconds of [pacing] energy.
Sound: [upbeat/trending audio style].
```

**Example:**
```
Eye-catching Instagram Reel. Opens with a whip-pan revealing a creator's
hands placing a splash of bright coral paint onto a canvas — immediate
visual hook. Camera cuts to a close-up of the paint mixing with teal in
slow-motion, swirling patterns forming. Then snaps to real-time: the
creator steps back to reveal the full piece, grinning. Bold neon lighting
from left (warm amber) and right (cool cyan) against a dark studio. 6
seconds of punchy, fast-paced energy with quick transitions. Sound:
satisfying paint splatter, bass-heavy lo-fi beat dropping on the reveal.
```

## Website Hero Background

```
Slow ambient video designed as a website hero background. [Scene description].
Camera [barely perceptible movement direction] over 8 seconds.
[Soft, atmospheric lighting]. [Subtle environmental motion].
No sudden changes, designed to loop seamlessly.
Sound: [ambient or none — this plays muted on web].
```

**Example:**
```
Slow ambient video designed as a website hero background. A creative workspace
viewed from slightly above — colorful design tools, a tablet, scattered
mood board images, and a steaming coffee cup on a warm wooden desk. Camera
drifts almost imperceptibly to the right over 8 seconds. Soft golden
afternoon light from a window, slowly shifting shadows across the surface.
Steam gently rises from the coffee cup, a phone screen subtly pulses with
a notification glow. No sudden changes, meditative pacing, designed to
loop seamlessly. Sound: quiet ambient room tone (plays muted on web).
```

## Ad Creative

```
[Product/service] promotional video. [Opening hook]. [Product reveal or
demonstration]. [Bold, brand-aligned visuals]. [Call-to-action-ready
final frame]. [Color palette]. Sound: [energetic/brand music].
```

**Example:**
```
Creative software promotional video. Opens with a split-screen comparison
— left side shows a dull, flat photo, right side shows the enhanced
version popping with color and clarity. A bold swipe transition reveals
the editing interface. Quick montage of different tools being applied:
background removal, style transfer, color correction — each with a
satisfying visual "snap." Bold warm amber and deep indigo accent lighting.
Final frame: clean product shot with space for CTA text overlay. Sound:
punchy electronic beat with satisfying digital transformation whooshes.
```

## Aerial Landscape

```
[Aerial movement type] over [landscape]. [Time of day] with [lighting].
[Weather/atmosphere]. [Scale and depth cues]. Shot on [drone/camera].
The mood is [mood]. Sound: [natural ambient].
```

**Example:**
```
Slow drone push-in over a misty mountain valley at dawn. Golden light
breaks through cloud layers, illuminating patches of forest below. Shot
on a cinema drone with a 24mm lens. Atmospheric haze creates visible
depth — foreground peaks sharp, distant mountains fading into soft blue.
A river winds through the valley, catching glints of early sunlight.
Small birds scatter from treetops as the drone passes. The mood is epic
and contemplative. Sound: wind rushing, distant bird calls, the river
audible as the drone descends.
```

---

## Behind-the-Scenes

```
Candid [activity] documentation. [Handheld/documentary camera style].
[Natural/available lighting]. [Authentic, unscripted moments].
[Warm, intimate color grade]. Sound: [natural, unedited audio].
```

**Example:**
```
Candid footage of a design team brainstorming around a whiteboard.
Handheld camera with natural micro-shake, documentary style. Available
fluorescent office light mixed with warm laptop screen glow. One person
sketches rapidly while others lean in, pointing at different sections.
Someone laughs at an idea — genuine, not posed. Post-it notes cover
the wall behind them in a colorful grid. Warm, slightly desaturated
color grade with lifted shadows. Sound: marker on whiteboard, overlapping
conversations, someone's phone buzzing on the table.
```

---

## Ambient / Mood

```
Abstract [visual subject] with [movement type]. [Slow/meditative pacing].
[Color palette]. [Texture and material description]. No recognizable
subjects, pure visual mood. Sound: [ambient/minimal].
```

**Example:**
```
Abstract ink dropped into water, blooming in slow-motion. Deep indigo
and warm coral pigments unfurl like underwater flowers, creating
organic fractal patterns. Camera locked off, shooting down into a glass
tank. Macro lens captures fine tendrils and micro-turbulence. The colors
gradually mix into deeper hues over 8 seconds. Lit from below with a
soft white light, creating a translucent, luminous quality. The mood is
hypnotic and meditative. Sound: deep, resonant ambient drone, subtle
water movement.
```

---

## Motion Graphics

```
[Motion graphic style] animation of [concept/data]. [Color palette].
[Typography/shape movement]. [Timing and easing]. Clean, [adjective]
broadcast-quality motion. Sound: [design/UI sounds].
```

**Example:**
```
Kinetic typography animation: the word "CREATE" explodes from the center
of frame in bold sans-serif, each letter arriving with a different motion
— bounce, slide, rotate, scale. Bold warm tones on a near-black
background. After assembling, the letters pulse once with a bright
glow, then transition smoothly into "REMIX" with a glitch-style morph.
Smooth easing with overshoot springs. Clean, bold, broadcast-quality
motion design. Sound: satisfying whoosh on each letter, bass thud on full
word, digital glitch texture on the morph.
```

---

## Event Hype / Launch

```
[Event/product launch] teaser. [Building momentum structure].
[Quick cuts / reveals]. [Bold visuals]. [Climactic final reveal].
[High-energy color grade]. Sound: [building, dramatic audio].
```

**Example:**
```
Product launch teaser building in intensity. Opens with a slow fade-in
on a dark screen — a single bright pixel grows into a line, then
branches into a circuit-board pattern. Quick cuts between: hands
typing on a keyboard, a cursor clicking "publish," confetti cannons
firing in a studio, a team high-fiving. Each cut faster than the last.
Camera push-ins get more aggressive with each beat. Colors intensify —
from muted to fully saturated. Final frame: bold text space for the
launch date against a deep gradient background. Sound: low rumble
building to an explosive bass drop with digital texture layers.
```

## Testimonial / Talking Head

```
[Person description] speaking to camera in [setting]. [Natural lighting].
[Camera framing — medium close-up]. [Slight movement for life].
[Warm, authentic color grade]. Sound: [dialogue + ambient].
```

**Example:**
```
A young designer in their late 20s speaks directly to camera in a
bright studio apartment. Natural window light from the right creates
a soft Rembrandt pattern on their face. Medium close-up framing with
a 50mm lens, shallow depth of field blurring colorful art on the wall
behind them. Subtle handheld micro-movement keeps the shot feeling
alive and unscripted. They gesture naturally while speaking, occasionally
glancing away in thought. Warm color grade with natural skin tones.
"The tools just let me focus on being creative," they say with a genuine
half-smile. Sound: clear dialogue, subtle room tone, distant traffic.
```
